# EEG Classification Model Project

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build a classification model for analyzing EEG data and categorizing it into different classes. EEG data is crucial in neuroscience and medical fields, particularly in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Two EEG datasets, the CHB-MIT EEG Database and the Bonn EEG Dataset, will be utilized to train and evaluate the classification model.

## Datasets
1. **CHB-MIT EEG Database:**
   - Contains EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy, featuring various seizure types and non-seizure data.
2. **Bonn EEG Dataset:**
   - Includes EEG recordings with a specific focus on epileptic seizures.

## Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Download and extract the datasets.
   - Explore the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
   - Preprocess EEG data if necessary, addressing issues like missing values, noise reduction, and data augmentation.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract relevant features from EEG signals, considering both time-domain and frequency-domain features.

3. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for EEG classification, considering models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

5. **Model Training:**
   - Train the selected model on the training data using appropriate training techniques.
   - Implement strategies to avoid overfitting, such as dropout or early stopping.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

7. **Testing:**
   - Assess the final model on the test set to ensure its generalization capability.

8. **Results and Visualization:**
   - Visualize the EEG data and model predictions.
   - Create plots and graphs to illustrate findings and showcase the performance of the classification model.
